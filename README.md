## Alzheimer Disease Severity Exam
The provided code is for an application designed to assess the severity of Alzheimer's disease based on user responses to a quiz. The quiz evaluates cognitive abilities and analyzes language patterns to provide insights into the user's cognitive impairment. Below is an analysis of the code:

##  Code Overview:
###  Dependencies:
express: Web application framework for Node.js.
body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
firebase: Integration with Firebase for data storage.
uuid: Generates unique identifiers.
pos: Part-of-speech tagging library for natural language processing.

## Express Setup:
Express app is created and configured.
Body-parser middleware is used to handle JSON and URL-encoded data.
Static files are served from the 'public' directory.
EJS is set as the view engine for rendering dynamic content.
## Firebase Integration:
Firebase is initialized with the provided fb.js module.
Database references are used to interact with Firebase Realtime Database.
User data is stored in the 'users' node.
Routes and Views:
Several routes are defined for different pages, such as home, stats, overview, help, page1, page3, admin, submitdata, and completequiz.
EJS templates are rendered for these routes.
## Quiz Logic:
User responses are collected through the 'submitdata' route.
The 'completequiz' route processes the quiz results.
The quiz includes an analysis of language patterns using the 'pos' library.
Marks are calculated based on the user's responses and language analysis.
## Statistical Overview:
The 'stats' route provides a statistical overview of user performance based on age groups.
Average marks are calculated for age groups 12-19, 20-30, 31-60, and > 60.
## Admin Dashboard:
The 'admin' route displays an admin dashboard with an overview of user data.
User data includes details such as year of birth, marks, and results.
## Alzheimer Severity Assessment:
The severity of Alzheimer's disease is determined based on the user's quiz performance:

If the user scores higher than (total_marks - 7), they are classified as having "No Cognitive Impairment."
If the user scores higher than (total_marks - 13) but less than or equal to (total_marks - 7), they are classified as having "Mild Cognitive Impairment."
If the user scores less than or equal to (total_marks - 13), they are classified as having "Severe Cognitive Impairment."
Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Set up Firebase credentials in the 'fb.js' module.
Run the application using npm start.
Note:
This application assumes a specific structure of the user's responses and language patterns to assess Alzheimer's disease severity.
Adjustments may be needed based on specific medical or research requirements.
